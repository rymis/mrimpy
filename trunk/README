J2M (Jabber2MRIM gateway)
	It is the jabber server, that translates XMPP protocol to MailRu Agent. The main goal of this project
is made available MailRu Agent protocol for GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and another operating systems not supported
by official software. At this moment you can use Jabber client software and it will work.

	You can use transport, for example mrim.jabber.ru, but your password will became to third side peaple.

Client software parameters.
	In general, you need to overide server parameter by setting it to localhost:5222. In PSI and Gajim you
must use "Connection" tab in account setup. In addition you must set "Allow plain passwords" for all connections.

Server.
	Run j2m_gw. It is all :) You can use switches, specified in j2m_gw --help
